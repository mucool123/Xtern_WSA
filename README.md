Hello!
I have used googlemaps API to get data. I cleaned and used the relevant data from API.
I have considered few things while planning the situation: 
A) I assumed that everyone meets near monument circle and hence the co-ordinates of that was taken as centre.
B) I tried to keep radius as small as possible.
C) I took only those place whose were open at that particular time keeping in mind their opening hours.
D) Have included places with highest rating but atleast it should have 500+ ratings.

This assesment took me 3 hrs 15 minutes. Hope you find my work suitable. 
Thank you for the opportunity !
